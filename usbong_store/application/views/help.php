				<li><span class="Help-subheader">What are your shipping rates/delivery times?</span><br>
					The shipping rate is already included in the price of each product item in the Usbong Store. Delivery times usually take one week after you've sent us a copy of your deposit slip.
				</li><br>
				<li><span class="Help-subheader">Can I combine more than one item in a single shipment?</span><br>
					Yes, as a matter of fact, the Usbong Store is designed to specifically cater to customers interested in purchasing more than one item at a time. We even offer discounts for each additional product item a customer purchases.
				</li><br>
				<li><span class="Help-subheader">Incorrect Shipping Address</span><br>
					If you need to update your shipping address, you can go to the link to the My Account page located to the left of your shopping cart.

				<li><span class="Help-subheader">Can I get a discount on a large order?</span><br>
					We strive to offer the best prices on the Internet. Moreover, we offer discounts for each additional product a customer purchases. The prices also already cover the shipping cost, so the customer need not have to pay additional fees. Even better, if the customer picks up the product items at the Marikina Orthopedic Specialty Clinic (MOSC), the customer receives a promo discount.
